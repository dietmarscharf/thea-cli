### ‚ö†Ô∏è Name Conflicts (Not True Duplicates)

**28 files share the same filename between BLUEITS and Ramteid accounts**, but checksum analysis confirms they are **different documents**:

- All 28 files have different MD5 checksums
- These are Tesla order documents from 2020-2024
- Each represents a different transaction for different company accounts
- The overwrite warning occurred because both companies have orders on the same dates

#### Examples of Name Conflicts:
- `Orderabrechnung_-bestaetigung_ISIN_US88160R1014_TESLA_INC_vom_15_07_2024.PDF`
  - BLUEITS version: MD5 `66c0e5db924bd436a24fb2a1d1ddf1b7`
  - Ramteid version: MD5 `8085c1301f6dc2f38531af2e66062a72`

## Recommendations

### Current Organization is Correct ‚úì
1. **Keep files in separate company directories** - They contain different account information
2. **No deduplication needed** - Files are not duplicates despite same names
3. **No files are missing** - All ZIP contents successfully extracted

### For Future Extractions
To avoid overwrite warnings:
1. Extract each company's ZIPs to their respective folders
2. Use the `--no-clobber` or `-n` option with unzip to skip existing files
3. Or extract to temporary folders first, then move files

## Files Generated

1. **duplicate_files_report.csv** - List of files with same names across companies
2. **duplicate_checksums.txt** - Detailed checksum comparison proving files are different
3. **file_inventory.txt** - Complete inventory of all 618 files organized by year
4. **extraction_verification.txt** - Verification that all files were extracted

## Conclusion

The extraction process was successful. The "duplicate" warning you received was a false alarm - these are legitimately different documents that happen to share the same filename because they represent similar transactions for different company accounts on the same dates. No action is required as the current organization is correct.
